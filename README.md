Admin Dashboard: Access the admin dashboard to manage user accounts, news articles, and match data.  

Login and Sign-Up: Users can create accounts, log in, and access personalized features.  

Responsive Design: The web application is designed to work seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

HTML/CSS: Used for structuring and styling the web pages.
